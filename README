PANEL (Parcellation and Netmat Evaluation Library)

PANEL is split into 5 modules.

DataLoader - provides additonal functionality for loading in CIFTI/NIFTI file, 
most of this is done through the nibabel.load() function but helper functions are
included in this module.


Feature Analysis - Provides methods for analysis the importance/significance of edges in netmats.
Two methods are supported based on GLM and Random Forests. 
Look at Edge_Evaluation.ipynb or Edge_Correlation.ipynb for examples.

Predictors - Provides a set of estimator which are automatically trained to predict
various HCP behavioural measures. Refer to Netmat_Evaluation.ipynb or Sparsity_Evaluation.ipynb
for examples. For most cases ElasticNetTuner will provide the best results

Graph Metrics - provides a series of different graph metric used to analyze netmats

FSLNets - is a python implementation of FMRIB's FSLNets and is used to generate 
netmats.


Refer to the notebooks for examples on how to use the various functions and modules.





Dependencies:
Scikit
Pandas
Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib
Scikit Neural Networks (For Neural Network Predictor Only)
Nibabel CIFTI Branch (still under development https://github.com/satra/nibabel/tree/enh/cifti2)
Jupyter Notebooks is needed to run any *.ipynb files which are not necessary for the core functionality.
